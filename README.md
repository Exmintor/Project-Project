Ari &amp; Gulli: 

In order to test the project have Unity 5.6 installed, download and open the FirstTest unitipackage, go into the "Scenes" folder, double click the FirstTest scene and press play. Talk to me first if you're looking to edit stuff. There's a way to do it where you don't have to copy the file per-se and where I can easily see the changes you're making and approve them.
